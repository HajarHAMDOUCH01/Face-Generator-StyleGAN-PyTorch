### This Repository is Style GAN in PyTorch , From this paper : [A Style-Based Generator Architecture for Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04948) 
### Data : FFHQ

### in epoch 26 / 100 
![image alt]()

### Inference :
- Run testing/test.py , it geneartes a new face using scripted model using Torchscript.

### Model weights :
Model will be in hugging face, ready to use via transformers.

### stay tuned for a web app for face generation.
